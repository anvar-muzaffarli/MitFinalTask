        <p>My journey towards healthier skin inspired me to develop products that really work,
          in a way thatâ€™s accessible to everyone. Rhode is dedicated to making products based
          in science and great formulation, simplifying many of the mysteries and complex narratives behind
          efficacious skincare. I hope these will become your go-to essentials that can live in your bathroom,
          be your favorite travel companion, improve your skin over time, and keep your skin happy and hydrated.
